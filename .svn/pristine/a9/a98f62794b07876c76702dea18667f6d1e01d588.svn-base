    <ion-card-content>
      <p>Your rights to return goods are protected under the EU Distance Selling Directive. Our return policies are as follows:</p>      
      <p>Damage in Transit - If you have received any damaged goods you need to inform us as soon as possible, and no later than three working days after receiving your order. You must also keep the packaging to allow for claims against the carrier. After you contact us, we will make a claim against the carrier and arrange for the damaged items to be replaced. We will provide (where possible) a link to Royal Mail web site where customer can generate and print a free return label. After receiving the goods, we will inspect them and assess the damage. If the product(s) are in perfect condition, the customer will be liable for the cost of the return and the initial postage charge.</p>
      <p>Any return must be unused, and include all the original packaging and tags. Please email us before returning goods to notify us of the intent and reason for return. We will not be able to refund items if any tags have been removed. Refunds are for the product(s) amount only. Goods must be sent back to us within 7 days of receiving them. We recommend you use a recorded service where you can provide a proof of postage.</p>
      <p>For bulk quantity orders over Â£100, there is a 25% return policy. That means that only a quarter of the order value will be accepted as a return. If there was a discount applied and the value of the return exceeds the discount value, that will also be deducted from the refund amount. For more information, please contact our customer services.</p>
